## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{bash, results = "hide"}
curl http://coreos3.pranageo.com/ocpu/apps/pranageo/graphileonR/R/grr_meananalysis/json -X POST -F sampledata=@/home/acizmeli/data/aaworks/GIT.repos/graphileon-rserve/graphileonR/inst/extdata/data.json 

```

```{r, results = "hide"}
list.files()
print("yes")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
